- **Fedora:** Cutting-edge features, community-driven.
- **Arch Linux:** Highly customizable, for advanced users.

# What is WSL

- **WSL** allows you to run a Linux distro directly on Windows.
- WSL works like a light-weight virtual machine (VM), no need for a dual-boot setup.

## Pros of WSL
- Easy Setup: Simple installation and configuration process.
- Resource Efficiency: Lightweight compared to full virtual machines.

## Cons of WSL
- File System Differences: File system performance and compatibility can vary between Linux and Windows files.
- Not a Full VM: Some Linux-specific functionalities and kernel modules might not work as expected.

# Installing WSL

- Open Windows Terminal
- Type `wsl --install`
- After installation has completed, reboot
- A prompt for username and password will be shown
- Enter any username and password (remember them!)
